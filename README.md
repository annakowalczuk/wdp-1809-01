# Tasks

Begin by running `npm install` to install all dependencies.
Then you can run some useful tasks:

```sh
$ npm run build
```

It makes a production version of the project, by copying all files from the `src/` directory to `dist/` and compiling sass files to compressed css file.

```sh
$ npm run watch
```

It's useful while working on the project. It runs a build task and starts a local server from the `dist/` directory. It also runs several parallel scripts that track changes in source files, update files on the local server and refresh a web browser.
